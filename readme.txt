Instructions for using the front end:
    Simply open the index.html file in your chosen browser, and type the value you wish to be converted 
    (using number symbols such as 1 or 872, etc) in any text box on the right or left hand side. The 
    resulting conversion value will appear in the corresponding box on the opposite side of the 
    conversion card. 

Instructions for operating the backend:
    In order to utilize the Node.js backend and its microservices, you must first open a terminal in the 
    project folder and start the local server by entering "node app.js".
